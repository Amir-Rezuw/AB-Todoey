# AB-Todoey

This app is developed based on iOS development bootcamp on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu you can enroll in this bootcamp using the link below

In this app I used Realm as data base of project, developed custom cell for table view, replaced newer codes with thoes parts that were deprecated.

Make sure to run command below before building app in the same directory that the project is placed:

<code>pod install</code>

Hope you enjey.
